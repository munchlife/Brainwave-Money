# Munch

Munch is a digital metabolism exposing a genetic programming environment and artifical immune system for evolving the bioelectromagnetic signals that circulate amongst earth and its life.

Munch can be deployed by running an electromagnetic or ultrasound beacon from appropriate hardware plugged in to Your front-end application. Calling the biosignal-interferometer function in Munch from [GET] /cell/instance/interferometer allows You to then map a degree of constructive or destructive interferencecalculated from [GET] /cell/:id/cycle/:cycleId?attribute:chargeTotal to "charges" generated during execution of signals communicating to and from life and cells in sequences of information cycles.
