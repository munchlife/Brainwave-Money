# Munch

Munch is an digital metabolism exposing a cellular organization platform designed to regulate a planetarily-correct evolution of the constructive and destructive communication cycles that build up and break down the planet and its life.

The digital metabolism is designed to work for any life type and allows life to network together by forming co-operative organizational "cells" (purpose-oriented "brainwave alignment DAOs") that leverage digital genes (program APIs where brainwave synchronization is performed i.e. dictionaries, news, social sites) to synchronize brainwaves within and between cells. 

The digital metabolism can be deployed by running the code on a "cell instance" that "mines" information carried in the "noosphere" (the collective set of bioelectromagnetic wavelengths transmitting consciousness) by capturing interferometric information on EEG signals through a "brainwave miner" (an EEG headset i.e. Muse S) connected to a front-end application.

[GET] /cell/instance/interferometer?

Calling the biosignal-interferometer instance function of the digital metabolism registers degrees of interference associated with a specific instance of communication signaling within a cell of communication synchronizing brainwaves through cycles of interaction with digital genes.

[GET] /cell/:id/cycle/:cycleId?attribute:chargeTotal

A degree of constructive or destructive interference then calculates a "charge" generated during execution of signals being sent to and from life in sequences of information cycles within a purpose-oriented cell.

INITIAL APPLICATION: IMMUNE

IMMUNE uses the biosignal-interferometry of the digital metabolism along with a dictionary API (a digital "gene") to assign an interference score to word definitions that involve charges between relevant stakeholder roles. As brainwaves are brought into alignment or misaligment when reflecting on a given word definition being charged cell stakeholders earn degrees constructive interference (credit) or destructive interference (debt) the objective being to become immune or exempt from destructive interference patterns for any given word definition thus optimizing the biolectric polarity of the word definition which then corresponds to the generation of an actual humoral immunity (literally defined as exemption from a specific cycle of oxidative stress) that gets encrypted into the body's immune system.
