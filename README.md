# Munch

Munch is a digital metabolism exposing a genetic programming environment and artifical immune system for evolving the bioelectromagnetic signals that circulate amongst earth and its life.

Munch is designed to work for any life type and allows life to network together by forming co-operative "cells" comprised of similarly-organized communication wavelengths.

Munch can be deployed by running an electromagnetic or ultrasound beacon from appropriate hardware plugged in to Your front-end application.

[GET] /cell/instance/interferometer

Calling the biosignal-interferometer instance function in Munch from registers degrees of interference associated with a specific instance of communication signaling within a cell.

[GET] /cell/:id/cycle/:cycleId?attribute:chargeTotal

A degree of constructive or destructive interference then calculates a "charge" generated during execution of signals being sent to and from life in sequences of information cycles within a cell of likeminded communication.

INITIAL APPLICATION: eyePhone

eyePhone uses Munch's biosignal-interferometry to obtain a "DreamMail" inbox that generates transcripts and receipts for a telepathic "who said what to Me" function (expected to be used mostly to record transcripts of dream conversations). The "who said what to Me" function tracks "voiceprint cookies" deposited in the field of a "cell phone" belonging to a life and can be isolated by using Munch's address function to map the interference to a specific brain region ("cell phone").
