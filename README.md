# Munch

Munch is a digital metabolism exposing a genetic programming environment and artifical immune system for evolving the bioelectromagnetic signals that circulate amongst earth and its life.

Munch is designed to work for any life type and allows life to network together by forming co-operative "cells" comprised of similarly-organized communication wavelengths that leverage digital "genes" (program APIs) as a platform to construct networks of signaling pathways (program API endpoint sequences) for consumption by life. 

Munch can be deployed by running a "digital cell" that "mines" information carried in bioelectromagnetic signals through an electromagnetic or ultrasound beacon connected to Your front-end application.

TODO: Include reference instance(s) that pegs Munch's "charges" API to the ionospheric ("schumann") resonances so as to provide a clearinghouse used to obtain planetarily-sound validity of information cycles by comparing the waveform of a life or cell signal with the waveform of the ionosphere resonances.

[GET] /cell/instance/interferometer

Calling the biosignal-interferometer instance function in Munch from registers degrees of interference associated with a specific instance of communication signaling within a cell.

[GET] /cell/:id/cycle/:cycleId?attribute:chargeTotal

A degree of constructive or destructive interference then calculates a "charge" generated during execution of signals being sent to and from life in sequences of information cycles within a cell of likeminded communication.

INITIAL APPLICATION: eyePhone

eyePhone uses Munch's biosignal-interferometry to obtain a "DreamMail" inbox that generates transcripts and receipts for a telepathic "who said what to Me" function (expected to be used mostly to record transcripts of dream conversations). The "who said what to Me" function tracks telepathic "voicemails" that deposit "voiceprint cookies" in the electromagnetic field of a life the effects of which can be isolated to specific location in the field by using Munch's address function to map the interference to the brain region where telepathic communication took place ("cell phone").

INITIAL APPLICATION: Game Of Chicken

Game Of Chicken uses Munch's biosignal-interferometry to obtain a "signal collision" map that works to plot outcomes for a series of statuses attribtued to a dispute regarding a cycle of information involved in intra and inter cell communication. The "signal collision" map instructs the life involved in a disputed information cycle on whether or not a suboptimal outcome ("go left or leave behind and ignore instances of destructive interference") optimal outcome ("go right and correct instances of destructive interference or deposit more instances of constructive interference) is being carried out. Game Of Chicken can be used to optimize the chirality of DNA within the electromagnetic field(s) that house networks of cells belogning to a life (thus establishing a new form of on-the-fly DNA repair based solely on optimizing the alignment of bio-interference circulating amongst cells).
